    <h1>NebulaSuit: An Upper-Body High-Density Vibrotactile Suit Built With Scalable Hardware Solutions</h1>
    <p>Vibrotactile systems are widely used in various applications. However, existing systems remain low in scalability and density. Vibrotactile feedback has not yet revealed its potential in large-scale and high-density applications. In this paper, we introduced NebulaSuit, a high-density upper-body suit featuring 124 vibrotactile actuators. With scalable design solutions such as self-contained vibration units and chain-connection topology, it supports high-bandwidth and low-latency communication, enabling fine-grained control of vibration parameters for each actuator. To demonstrate the potential of high-density feedback, we conducted two studies: a study measured information transfer values of 4.92 bits (body) and 4.68 bits (arm), which surpassed all previous body-worn vibrotactile systes; a VR fitness application study demonstrated improved user performance and immersion via pose-correction
